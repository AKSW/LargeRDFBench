#summary How to calculate various measures of benchmark datasets and queries?

For all of the given dataset and query features, you first need to download the Java [http://goo.gl/8ql1UA BigRDFBench_Util.jar] and include into the java project. The complete source code for this tool can also be checkout from SVN link http://bigrdfbench.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. 

== Dataset Structuredness ==

Duan et al. " Apples and Oranges: A Comparison of RDF Benchmarks and Real RDF Datasets" introduced the notion of structuredness or choerence, which indicates whether the instances in a dataset have only a few or all attributes of their types set. They show that artificial datasets are typically highly structured and “real” datasets are less structured.  For a given dataset,the structuredness value ranges [0,1] with 0 means less structured and 1 means high structured dataset. A federated SPARQL query benchmark should comprise datasets of varying structuredness values. You can calculate the structuredness value for a dataset (hosted as SPARQL endpoint) as follow. 

{{{
String endpointUrl = "http://localhost:8894/sparql";   //endpoint URL
String namedGraph = "http://aksw.org/benchmark";   // named Graph
double coherence = StructurednessCalculator.getStructurednessValue(endpointUrl, namedGraph);
System.out.println("\nOverall Structuredness or Coherence: " + coherence);

}}}

A sample output for Affymetrix dataset is given below: 
{{{
Total rdf:types: 3

1 : Type: http://rdfs.org/ns/void#Dataset
Coverage : 0.6
Weighted Coverage : 8.442659916291027E-6

2 : Type: http://bio2rdf.org/affymetrix_vocabulary:Probeset
Coverage : 0.5066791705833019
Weighted Coverage : 0.9999824111251744

3 : Type: http://bio2rdf.org/dataset_vocabulary:Endpoint
Coverage : 1.0
Weighted Coverage : 9.146214909315279E-6

Overall Structuredness or Coherence: 0.506684470477653
}}}

The details about coverage and weighted coverage can be found in Duan et al. paper. The complete structuredness and type coverage results for all of the BigRDFBench datasets is given [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzemFAUFXpqOMXRLaHdueWlOUlE/view?usp=sharing here]

== Details ==
Please first read BigRDFBench paper to understand these query features. 

Put all of your benchmark queries in a folder (one query per file). Query Features for all of the queries can be printed as follow. 

{{{
String inputDir= "../BigRDFBench-Utilities/queries/";
File folder = new File(inputDir);
File[] listOfFiles = folder.listFiles();
long count = 1; 
for (File qryFile : listOfFiles)
  {	
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new              FileReader(inputDir+qryFile.getName()));
    String line;
    String queryStr="";
	while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) 
                {
		   queryStr= queryStr+" "+line;
		}
         br.close();
    System.out.println("--------\n"+count+ ": "+qryFile.getName()+" Query: " + queryStr);
    QueryStatistics.printQueryStats(queryStr,qryFile.getName());
    count++;
   }
}}}
