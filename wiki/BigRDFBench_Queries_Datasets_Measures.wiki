#summary How to calculate various measures of benchmark datasets and queries?

For all of the given dataset and query features, you first need to download the Java [http://goo.gl/8ql1UA BigRDFBench_Util.jar] and include into the java project. The complete source code for this tool can also be checkout from SVN link http://bigrdfbench.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. 

== Dataset Structuredness ==

Duan et al. " Apples and Oranges: A Comparison of RDF Benchmarks and Real RDF Datasets" introduced the notion of structuredness or choerence, which indicates whether the instances in a dataset have only a few or all attributes of their types set. They show that artificial datasets are typically highly structured and “real” datasets are less structured.  For a given dataset,the structuredness value ranges [0,1] with 0 means less structured and 1 means high structured dataset. A federated SPARQL query benchmark should comprise datasets of varying structuredness values. You can calculate the structuredness value for a dataset (hosted as SPARQL endpoint) as follow. 

{{{
String endpointUrl = "http://localhost:8894/sparql";   //endpoint URL
String namedGraph = "http://aksw.org/bigrdfedbench/";  // named Graph
double coherence = StructurednessCalculator.getStructurednessValue(endpointUrl, namedGraph);
System.out.println("\nOverall Structuredness or Coherence: " + coherence);
